# Optimizers for use with Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis
A project that implements deep canonical correlation analysis to compare optimizers on the XRMB dataset. 
The XRMB dataset can be found at https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/XRMB_data/full/README.

To set up the project, download the XRMB dataset and place it into the root folder. Then, run main.py. 
You can choose the run mode (l-bfgs or sgd) with the mode variable in main.py. For a full explanation, feel free to open the report.

A lot of this code is inspired by the following works: \

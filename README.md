# Optimizers for use with Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis
A project that implements deep canonical correlation analysis to compare optimizers on the XRMB dataset. 
The XRMB dataset can be found at https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/XRMB_data/full/README.

A lot of this code is inspired by the following works: \
